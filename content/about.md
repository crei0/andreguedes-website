# About

I started playing with computers ([ZX Spectrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum)) at a very young age.

Eventually I started doing static websites, graphical design, 2D animation using Flash, and after that creating dynamic websites using Ruby on Rails and PHP.

I went to university and because I already knew how to program and do graphical design, I didn't felt challenged enough... So with a friend, we made a Flash game where you flew an helicopter and saved people around the sidescrolling map.

I've worked in newspapers, on the Advertising department, managing the digital ad campaigns, creating all the code for the interactive advertising formats and maintaining all the ad delivery code and ad platforms.

Eventually I left advertising so I could focus more on being a developer, starting by doing WordPress code and JavaScript features.

Later I was learning C# and Unity (game engine), so I ended up in a C# software factory, there I did C#, and with Angular me and a colleague created a [WYSIWYG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG) interface creator that you could drag and drop the elements, the purpose of this app was to replace an old/barely maintained UI editor.

I got an opportunity to leave my home country (Portugal), and move to Belgium, there I worked as Javascript/Frontend developer, then as React developer and NodeJS developer.

After more than 10 years doing development, I wanted to take a career break, because since I was a young kid I always wanted to make a 3D computer game.

It took around 1.5 years, but I was able to make a computer game called [Little Resort Simulator](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3323050/Little_Resort_Simulator/).
